- 👋 Hi, I’m Stano - a curious software engineer.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, Substrate and blockchain development.

- 👀 I’m interested in building stuff. Literally, coming up with an idea and shaping it is often times more important than perfectly designed code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Substrate-based projects, mostly anything Rust-related.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
